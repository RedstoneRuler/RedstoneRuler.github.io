rover|neutral|left|Heya! You excited for today?
claude|happy|right|Heck yeah I am! This is like a one-time chance for me, I CAN'T miss it!
claude|neutral|right|Thanks for setting it up, by the way!
rover|neutral|left|Ah! Don’t mention it! It's what friends are for.
rover|flustered|left|Uhhh but I don’t wanna be THAT guy but— you sure this is worth skipping class for?
claude|neutral|right|Oh don't be such a worrywart! I just wanna meet him and do a quick sing-off!
claude|confident|right|Then I'll skidaddledoodledoo back to the academy in NO TIME!
rover|awkward|left|You really have to take your education\nseriously.
claude|curious|right|Aww c'mon, where's the fun in that?! Reading books and doing all that hooky dooky stuff is boring, where's the adventure?
rover|awkward|left|Haha w-well the problem with that is...
rover|awkward|left|Out of all the students in that college... you're prooobably the only person who doesn't even\nknow how to fly yet.
rover|awkward|left|And I hate seeing people make fun of you for\nthat.
claude|shocked|right|WOAH WOAH! Put your guns away!
claude|curious|right|You didn't have to mention that, jeez!\nI don't need to be torn apart right now!
claude|happy|right|Besides, I always got you to be my taxi in shining armor!
claude|happy|right|...Well, minus that shining armor part!
rover|awkward|left|Riiiight. Is that all I am to you?
claude|happy|right|Well I COULD just jog all the way to the academy myself if I wanted to!
claude|neutral|right|But it just doesn't feel right going alone without you!
rover|flustered|left|O-Oh! Well... likewise?
claude|neutral|right|What? Was it something I said?
rover|awkward|left|Mmm. It’s nothin'.
rover|neutral|left|Anyways, that person we invited should be\narriving here pretty soon, so let's get you up\nto speed with some warm up!
claude|determined|right|ALRIGHT! Better safe than sorry! Let's do this!
rover|wand|left|Here goes! Remember what we practiced!
